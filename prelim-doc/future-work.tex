\chapter{Ongoing and Future Work: Translator-agnostic Translation Validation}\label{sec:problem}
Here is where you discuss the two approaches, using DDEC or machine learning.  But start with a brief paragraph explaining how this fits into the overall approach described in Chapter 4.
\cmt{ 
    the two primary goals in mind: (1) Language independence, and (2) Translator
    independence. 
}
\cmt{Both of these approaches  are translator specific and ad-hoc. Whereas,
    we would like the proof generator to work uniformly across translators.}
\cmt{However, we want the
proof generator to be agnostic of the binary-translator involved, which makes
the problem  even more challenging.}
