%many people. Many thanks to my adviser, Lawrence T. Strongarm, who

%Karin Vegas, and Cindy Willy, who offered guidance and support.
%Thanks to the University of Illinois Graduate College for awarding
%me a Dissertation Completion Fellowship, providing me with the

%my husband, parents, and numerous friends who endured this long
%process with me, always offering support and love.
