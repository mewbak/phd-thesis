\section{Decompilers: Facilitating Binary Analysis}\label{sec:decompilers}

Despite the various challenges in analyzing machine code (Refer Section~\ref{sec:ba}), there has been
impressive amount of work to rebuild a close approximation of the original source code from a
compiled binary using various decompilation frameworks~\cite{McSema:Recon14,Remill,Angr1,BAP:CAV11,Radare2,FCD,BitBlaze:2008,hexray,Fokin:2011,eschulte2018bed,katz2018rnn,Schwartz:2013,IDA,mctoll,revgen}.

Binary analysis using a decompilation framework is achieved by (1) Binary decompilation/lifting: Translating
machine code to a intermediate representation (IR), which precisely represents
the operational semantics of the binary code. The lifted IR exposes many
high-level properties (like control flow, function boundary and prototype,
    variable and their type etc.) of the the binary, which are otherwise lost
during the compilation pipeline, and (2) performing the analysis at the IR
level.  Analyzing the binary using the abstractions lifted to such high-level
IR assist further analysis and/or optimization. We note that the IR, being the basis for any binary analysis techniques, the faithfulness of the lifting or decompilation process is highly desirable. 

Binary analyzes are mostly agnostic to any specific high-level IR, but many
projects~\cite{McSema:Recon14,Remill,FCD,reopt,mctoll} prefer to employ LLVM
IR~\cite{Lattner:2004}. LLVM IR, being an industry standard compiler IR, enables many analyses and
optimizations out-of-the-box which allows building a static binary analyzer
with minimal effort.
